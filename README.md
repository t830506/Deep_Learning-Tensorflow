# deep-learning-coursera
### Description
This class introduces the concepts and practices of deep learning. The course consists of three parts.  
1. In the first part, we give a quick introduction of classical machine learning and review some key concepts required to understand deep learning.  
2. In the second part, we discuss how deep learning differs from classical machine learning and explain why it is effective in dealing with complex problems such as the image and natural language processing. Various CNN and RNN models will be covered.  
3. In the third part, we introduce the deep reinforcement learning and its applications.  
  
This course also gives coding labs. We will use Python 3 as the main programming language throughout the course. Some popular machine learning libraries such as Scikit-learn and Tensorflow will be used and explained in detials.
